# TerminalChess
C++ script to play a simple game of chess in the terminal. No GUI's need apply.

Simply run the script and play on any OS. There is text to the right of the board which explains how to input moves.
There are options to make the board look cleaner on unix OS's using unicode characters and terminal manipulation control
sequences. This code is commented out within the cpp file, with additional comments explaining the necessary code to
add/remove/uncomment.
